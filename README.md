## My process

When you want to collect feedback on a website, having a widget embedded on your site is the most effective way to go about it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- SweetAlert 



### What I learned

-The pageY : read-only property of the MouseEvent returns the Y coordinate in pixels relative to  the whole documnet


- After I have used SweetAlert library(first time used), I found it would be better if i didn't use it.

### Continued development
