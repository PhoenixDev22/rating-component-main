## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
- Adding a pop up message using sweet alert, when the user submitted the feedback and did not select a rating.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- SweetAlert 



### What I learned

-The pageY : read-only property of the MouseEvent returns the Y coordinate in pixels relative to  the whole documnet


- After I have used SweetAlert library(first time used), I found it would be better if i didn't use it.

### Continued development
